# ðŸš€ Auto-Deploy Test

This file was created to test the automatic deployment system.

## How it works:
1. Push to main branch: `git push vps main`
2. VPS post-receive hook triggers automatically
3. Code is deployed and service restarts
4. Health check confirms deployment success

## Test Results:
- **Test Timestamp**: 2025-08-07 21:30
- **Status**: Testing automatic deployment...
