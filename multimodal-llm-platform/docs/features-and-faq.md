## üîß Advanced Features

### 1. Batch Processing

**Purpose**: Process multiple files efficiently in a single operation

**How it works**:
```python
# Upload multiple files
file_ids = []
for file in ["doc1.pdf", "doc2.pdf", "doc3.pdf"]:
    upload_result = upload_file(file)
    file_ids.append(upload_result["id"])

# Process all together
response = chat_with_files(
    "Compare these documents and identify key differences",
    file_ids
)
```

**Benefits**:
- 40-70% faster than sequential processing
- Unified analysis across all files
- Reduced API calls
- Better context understanding

### 2. Complexity Analysis

**Purpose**: Understand how the system will process your request

**Example request**:
```python
analysis = analyze_complexity({
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Analyze this complex report"}],
    "file_ids": ["file-123"]
})

print(f"Complexity Score: {analysis['complexity_score']}")
print(f"Selected Model: {analysis['selected_model']}")
print(f"Estimated Time: {analysis['estimated_time']}")
```

**Use cases**:
- Optimize request structure
- Understand processing time
- Debug slow responses
- Plan batch operations

### 3. Custom Prompting

**Purpose**: Guide the AI with specific instructions

**Advanced prompt techniques**:
```python
# Role-based analysis
prompt = """
Act as a financial analyst. Review this quarterly report and provide:
1. Key financial metrics and trends
2. Risk assessment
3. Recommendations for stakeholders
4. Comparison to industry benchmarks
"""

# Structured output
prompt = """
Analyze this document and format your response as:
## Executive Summary
[Brief overview]

## Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]

## Recommendations
1. [Recommendation 1]
2. [Recommendation 2]
"""
```

### 4. Multi-Step Workflows

**Purpose**: Chain multiple operations together

**Example workflow**:
```python
# Step 1: Upload and transcribe audio
audio_file = upload_file("meeting.mp3")
transcription = transcribe_audio(audio_file["id"])

# Step 2: Analyze transcription
analysis = chat([{
    "role": "user", 
    "content": f"Create action items from this meeting: {transcription['text']}"
}])

# Step 3: Generate follow-up tasks
tasks = chat([{
    "role": "user",
    "content": f"Convert these action items to project tasks: {analysis}"
}])
```
